        <h4> <b>Automated science?</b> </h4>
        The list of human activities performed by machines has greatly expanded with
        recent developments in artificial intelligence, machine leaning, data mining and big data.
        On that list may now figure science and engineering.<br> 
        In 2009 a program developped at Cornell "discovered" Newton's second law (F = ma), without human input. 
        This was accomplished by randomly generating algebraic expressions to model the motion of an oscillating pendulum, in
        combination with a genetic algorithm to identify the most insightful of these analytic formulations.<br>
        <br>
        <a href="http://www.wired.com/2009/04/newtonai/"> Computer Program self-discovers laws of physics</a><br>
        <br>
        The program, now called <a href="http://www.nutonian.com/products/eureqa/">Eurequa</a> is one of the new generation 
        of analytics plateforms (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watson_%28computer%29">IBM's Watson</a>)
        that can be used for tasks traditionally performed by technicians, scientists, engineers and data scientists.<br>
        With the ever more complex systems analyzed, and ever larger amounts of data available, these machines are seen
        as a great augmentation, if not replacement, to scientists and engineers that will increase efficiency and productivity in 
        industries from <a href="http://www.wired.com/2009/04/robotscientist/"> drug development</a> to <a href="http://www.engineering.com/AdvancedManufacturing/ArticleID/10408/Will-Eureqa-Replace-Engineers.aspx"> aerospace design</a>.

        In Douglas Adam's "Hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy",Deep Thought, the advanced computer, after 7.5 millions years, 
        was able to compute the answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything.
        The answer was, incomprehensibly, 42.<br>
        The automated computer scientist poses the same dilemna. Unless
        the machine also build theories and conceptual framework to understand the relations it discovered,
        it will be difficult to make sense, trust, and generalize the findings. With ver increasing complex problems
        being solved by machines, <a href="https://edge.org/response-detail/11385">insight and understanding</a> may 
        be pushed beyond human abilities<br>
